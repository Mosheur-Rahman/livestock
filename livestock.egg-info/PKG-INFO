Description: # Livestock
        
        What can Livestock do? Livestock enables the user to calculate outdoor thermal 
        comfort where the evapotranspiration of vegetation is taken into account. 
        Livestock includes a wrapper around the Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF), 
        which is a CPython library to create and compute hydrological models. 
        With CMF and Livestock it is possible to make hydrological models directly in 
        Grasshopper and therefore study surface run-off, soil infiltration etc. 
        Which can be used in Storm Water Management.
        
        Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a 
        underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package
