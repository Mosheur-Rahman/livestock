# Livestock

What can Livestock do? Livestock enables the user to calculate outdoor thermal 
comfort where the evapotranspiration of vegetation is taken into account. 
Livestock includes a wrapper around the Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF), 
which is a CPython library to create and compute hydrological models. 
With CMF and Livestock it is possible to make hydrological models directly in 
Grasshopper and therefore study surface run-off, soil infiltration etc. 
Which can be used in Storm Water Management.

Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a 
underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package

Livestock is the name of the plug-in for Grasshopper, that has been developed 
for the thesis of Christian Kongsgaard. Livestock is currently being developed
and maintained by Christian Kongsgaard and Kristoffer Negendahl.
