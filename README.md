# Livestock

What can Livestock do? Livestock enables the user to calculate outdoor thermal 
comfort where the evapotranspiration of vegetation is taken into account. 
Livestock includes a wrapper around the Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF), 
which is a CPython library to create and compute hydrological models. 
With CMF and Livestock it is possible to make hydrological models directly in 
Grasshopper and therefore study surface run-off, soil infiltration etc. 
Which can be used in Storm Water Management.

Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a 
underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package

Livestock is the name of the plug-in for Grasshopper, that has been developed 
for the thesis of Christian Kongsgaard. Livestock is currently being developed
and maintained by Christian Kongsgaard and Kristoffer Negendahl.


# Notes
model hygro and hydrothermal effects on the micro climate around buildings to enable/evaluate sustainable solutions, 
where those effects are incorporated.

aims at being a high performance package, by implementing the [Livestock Template Method](https://ocni-dtu.github.io/how-is-it-working.html) 
for fast and scalable computations.

# Imposter Syndrome

I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can read here (link).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
