# Livestock
Livestock is a package for Grasshopper providing components for modelling water movement and hydrothermal effects 
around buildings to enable and evaluate sustainable solutions, where those effects are incorporated.

We have two focus areas: Surface Water Run-Off and Outdoor Thermal Comfort.
We are using CMF - [Catchment Modelling Framework](https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf) as our base for hydrological 
modelling. The hydrologic models can be used to investigate storm water management solutions at a high accuracy or 
be used as an input to an outdoor thermal comfort model.

Livestock aims at being a high performance package, by implementing the 
[Livestock Template Method](https://ocni-dtu.github.io/how-is-it-working.html) for fast and scalable computations.

Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a 
underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package

Livestock is the name of the plug-in for Grasshopper, that has been developed 
for the [master thesis](https://ocni-dtu.github.io/pages/portfolio.html) of Christian Kongsgaard. 
Livestock is currently being developed and maintained by Christian Kongsgaard and Kristoffer Negendahl.

## Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer: 
I want your help. No really, I do.
There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn 
another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.
I assure you, that's not the case.
This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can read [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations 
and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.
And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback 
about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)
Thank you for contributing!
